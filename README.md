# Nizar-Abdel - Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I'm Nizar! I have an academic background in Mathematics and Economics (MSc) and a strong passion for data analysis and modeling. I’m currently focused on developing my skills in SQL, Python, and Power BI, with the goal of becoming a data-driven problem solver in a professional setting.

During my studies, I worked with statistical models, optimization, and real-world data, and developed a deep interest in turning raw data into meaningful insights. My thesis focused on portfolio optimization using Deep Reinforcement Learning, giving me hands-on experience in data modeling and algorithm design.

In my free time, I enjoy learning new tools, exploring open datasets, and building projects that sharpen my analytical thinking. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I’m motivated by the challenge of finding patterns in data and creating solutions that add value.

This repository showcases my learning journey and projects within Data Analytics and Data Science.
