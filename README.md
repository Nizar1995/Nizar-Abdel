# 📊 Nizar Abdel – Data Analyst Portfolio

## 📌 About  
Hi, I'm Nizar! I have an academic background in Mathematics and Economics (MSc) and a strong passion for data analysis and modeling. I’m currently focused on developing my skills in **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**, with the goal of becoming a data-driven problem solver in a professional setting.

During my studies, I worked with statistical models, optimization, and real-world data, and developed a deep interest in turning raw data into meaningful insights. My thesis focused on portfolio optimization using Deep Reinforcement Learning, giving me hands-on experience in data modeling and algorithm design.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new tools, working with open datasets, and building projects that sharpen my analytical thinking. Whether working independently or on a team, I’m driven by the challenge of uncovering patterns and solving real problems through data.
